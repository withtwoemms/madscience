# Lab Experiment Tracker
# Norms and Expectations

* Strict split-up of duties, mirroring corporate environment
* Group expectation of 7 pm cutoff for working each day
* Strict scrum-style small sprints, with something "working and testable" as goal for each
* Trello for project management
* TravisCI and SimpleCov for "testing the tests"
  * [TravisCI]: https://travis-ci.org/
  * [SimpleCov]: https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov
* factory_girl and capybara for RSpec
* AirBnB styleguides for Ruby and Javascript
  * [Ruby styleguide]: https://github.com/airbnb/ruby
  * [Javascript styleguide]: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
* Code review and pull requests:
  * No designated merger of pull requests, simply one of the other two members
  * No tagging others in pull requests, simply inform them orally as you sit next to them
  * Tests for each sprint written in the next sprint
  * Refactoring for each sprint takes place in the sprint after, following tests
